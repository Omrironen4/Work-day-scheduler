# Work-day-scheduler-homework-5
This homework assignment required to make a work day scheduler with the help of starter code in html and css. 
The goal is to create a daily planner that functions accordingly with the time. Using color coordination, marking in different colors the past, present, and future allows the user for an easier time management. 
When the user types in their "todos" the application saves the input in local storage, so the user can access their todos at any given time.
Here is the link for my work day scheduler:
